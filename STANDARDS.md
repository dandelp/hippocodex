- Include relevant background information
- Define clear, testable scenarios
- Use consistent terminology
- Document edge cases and error conditions

### 3. Feature Scenarios

- Use clear, business-focused language
- Include specific examples
- Cover both happy and error paths
- Document preconditions in Background

### 4. Feature Cross-References

## Gherkin Example

```gherkin
Feature: Documentation System

  As a user of Eventable UI
  I want to access and interact with documentation
  So that I can effectively use and contribute to the platform

  Background:
    Given I am using Eventable UI
    And I have opened the documentation
    And the documentation system is initialized

  Scenario: Document Navigation
    When I navigate to a documentation page
    Then the document should load successfully
    And the navigation state should be updated
    And the table of contents should reflect the current document
```

## Document-Driven Development Process

The platform follows a document-driven development approach where documentation precedes and guides implementation. This top-down approach ensures clear understanding of requirements, promotes consistent design, and creates a shared vision before code is written.

### Separation of Concerns

Documentation is structured with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Concepts (WHAT and WHY)**: Define what a feature is and why it exists
2. **Features (BEHAVIOR)**: Specify how a feature should behave
3. **Implementation (HOW)**: Detail technical implementation

This separation allows stakeholders to engage at the appropriate level of abstraction:

- Business stakeholders can focus on concepts
- Product teams can focus on features and behavior
- Engineering teams can focus on implementation details

### Top-Down Development Flow

Follow this sequence when developing new functionality:

#### 1. Concept Documentation (WHAT and WHY)

- Start by defining the high-level concept
- Document the problem being solved
- Explain why the solution is valuable
- Identify key principles and constraints
- Outline user experience goals
- Define integration points

**Example**: `navigation.md` explains what documentation navigation is and why it's important, without specifying implementation details.

#### 2. Feature Specification (BEHAVIOR)

- Document the expected behavior using Gherkin
- Focus on user interactions and outcomes
- Define clear scenarios and examples
- Specify edge cases and error conditions
- Document acceptance criteria

**Example**: `sidebar.feature` specifies how the sidebar navigation should behave in different scenarios, without dictating implementation.

#### 3. Implementation Documentation (HOW)

- Detail the technical approach
- Document component architecture
- Explain design decisions
- Provide code examples
- Document integration details
- Specify performance considerations

**Example**: `sidebar.md` in the implementation directory explains how the sidebar is technically implemented.

### Benefits of Document-Driven Development

- **Alignment**: Creates shared understanding across teams
- **Clarity**: Forces clear thinking before implementation
- **Maintainability**: Documentation serves as a reference during maintenance
- **Onboarding**: Makes it easier for new team members to understand the system
- **Testing**: Provides clear behavior specifications for testing
- **Review**: Enables review of concepts and behavior before implementation

### Document Evolution

Documentation should evolve through these stages:

1. **Draft**: Initial concepts and ideas
2. **Review**: Peer review and refinement
3. **Approved**: Accepted as the basis for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Updated during implementation
5. **Verified**: Confirmed to match the actual implementation
6. **Maintained**: Updated as the system evolves

### Usage Guidelines

- Start new features by creating concept documentation
- Review concept docs with stakeholders before proceeding
- Create feature specifications based on approved concepts
- Review feature specs with product and engineering teams
- Document implementation details during development
- Update documentation when implementation changes
- Cross-reference between concept, feature, and implementation docs
